### üöö Shipping Cost vs Order Priority: Was Spending Appropriate?

**üß† Scenario:**

- **Delivery Truck** = Cheapest but slowest option

- **Express Air** = Fastest but most expensive option

**Expected use:**

- High-priority orders should use **Express Air**

- Low-priority orders should use **Delivery Truck**

#### üîç What We Found:

**‚ùå Insight:**

The shipping methods often did not align with the order priorities:

- **Delivery Truck** was used for high-priority orders.

- **Express Air** was used for low-priority orders.

This mismatch led to inefficient spending and wasted resources. Instead of optimizing for urgency and cost, shipping choices were frequently made inappropriately, resulting in a misalignment between speed, cost, and order priority.

**‚úÖ Recommendation:**

- Use Delivery Truck only for low-priority or non-urgent bulk shipments.

- Reserve Express Air for critical or time-sensitive orders.
